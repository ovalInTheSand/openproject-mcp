      2. POST /api/v3/work_packages (commit with validated payload)
      3. Handle validation errors in structured format

design_decisions_guardrails:
  - "Use Streamable HTTP exclusively; no SSE."
  - "Keep server thin (Hono Worker) + KISS; logic in tools with clear Zod schemas."
  - "Expose error details verbatim to Inspector (status/body) to speed debugging."
  - "Disallow overriding Authorization header in outbound OP fetch."
  - "Prefer HTTPS to OpenProject; require explicit CA trust in dev."
  - "Use forms-first for create/update; require lockVersion for PATCH."
  - "Limit CORS to ALLOWED_ORIGINS; wildcard only when list empty in dev."

implementation_notes:
  op_fetch:
    - "Build URL via joinUrl + withQuery; JSON-encode `filters` and `sortBy` strings where needed."
    - "Retry backoff for 429/5xx with jitter; surface upstream JSON errors."
    - "Scrub Authorization from error echo."
  pagination:
    - "Use parseCollectionMeta(total,count,pageSize,offset); compute nextOffset when available."
  attachments:
    - "multipart/form-data with boundary; base64 decode to Blob; set filename and description."
  queries:
    - "Support saved queries listing and execution; allow overriding filters, sortBy, pageSize, offset."
    - "Consider `eprops` compression for long combined query props."

inspector_test_results_summary:
  observation:
    - "All tools return a text block + structuredContent; Inspector shows ✅."
  gaps:
    - "End-to-end `wp.create` and `wp.update` require a real projectId/typeId + lockVersion."
    - "Attachment tool requires an existing WP and binary payload test."

what_is_left:
  must_have:
    - "Set OP_BASE_URL to https and configure NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS in dev."
    - "Run real-path tests for each tool with valid project/type/status/priority IDs."
    - "Finalize `wp.update` happy-path + failure cases (stale lockVersion)."
    - "Exercise `queries.list` and `queries.run` against real saved queries."
  should_have:
    - "Add small completions (e.g., typeId, projectId) via future SDK `completable` for UX."
    - "Add rate limiting and basic request logging (counts per tool)."
    - "Enable DNS rebinding protection on transport in prod; restrict allowedHosts."
  nice_to_have:
    - "OAuth2 flow (server-to-server) if org policy prefers Bearer tokens."
    - "Expose attachments listing/deleting for parity."

tried_and_ruled_out:
  - "Using SSE transport — deprecated; Streamable HTTP is standard path."
  - "Letting clients override Authorization header — rejected for security."
  - "Blind POST for create/update — replaced with forms-first."
