# Changelog

All notable changes to the OpenProject MCP Server will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [2.0.0] - 2025-08-28

## [3.2.0] - 2025-08-30

### üîê Security & Observability Hardening
Added env-driven rate limiting overrides, increased default body limit (512KB), Retry-After headers, per-tool execution timeouts with override map, SSE connection cap, HMAC request integrity (optional), nonce replay protection, IP hashing privacy option, egress allowlist enforcement, and comprehensive input size/depth guards.

### üìä New Introspection & Metrics
- New tools: `system.getCapabilities`, `system.getMetrics`.
- In-memory counters: requests, rate-limited, tool call outcomes, latency buckets.
- Request correlation via `x-request-id` header.

### üßÆ EVM & Hybrid Validation
Refined EVM forecast variants: added `spiCpiPure` (PMBOK combined index) as authoritative default, legacy `spiCpiLegacy`, backward-compatible alias `spiCpiCombined`‚Üípure, deferred rounding, normalized null EV to 0; added live validation & atomic reconciliation scripts.

### üìÑ Documentation
README updated with environment variable matrix, capability discovery, metrics, and HMAC signing instructions. SECURITY-CHECKLIST expanded with runtime controls.

### ‚úÖ Reliability Improvements
Unified error codes (`tool_timeout`, `upstream_error`, `validation_error`, `auth_failed`, `input_limit_exceeded`) in structuredContent for consistent client handling; refined injection test to allow functional timeouts while prohibiting string-eval patterns.

### ‚ôªÔ∏è Internal
Centralized metrics module, enhanced middleware with layered guards, and per-tool timeout resolution.

No breaking API changes; minor additive capabilities (two new system tools). Recommended upgrade for stronger security posture.

## [3.3.0] - 2025-08-30

### ‚úÖ Summary
Incremental security & reliability hardening atop 3.2.0 with scoped RBAC, enforced HTTPS (opt-out flag), abortable tool execution, improved cache discipline, and enhanced metrics. All changes are backward compatible & additive. Recommended for all users adopting 3.x security controls.

### üîê Security / Access Control
- Added environment‚Äëdriven RBAC scope gating (`MCP_TOOL_SCOPES` + `x-mcp-scopes` header) with denial metrics.
- HTTPS enforcement for `OP_BASE_URL`; clear opt‚Äëin override via `OP_ALLOW_INSECURE_HTTP=true` (development only).
- Prototype pollution guard expanded & centralized; weak secret rejection retained.
- Error redaction now masks additional credential-shaped keys consistently.

### ‚è±Ô∏è Execution Control
- Introduced AbortController-based per-tool cancellation; long running tools are actively aborted (including upstream fetch) when exceeding timeout.
- Unified timeout error code: `tool_timeout` with structured detail.

### üóÑÔ∏è Caching & Data Integrity
- Cache manager: precise hit/miss accounting moved into `get()`, soft LRU-style eviction (oldest entries pruned at cap) to prevent unbounded growth.
- Portfolio/hybrid manager: normalized composite cache keys (sorted identifiers) preventing duplicate entries; resource utilization entries timestamped (`_cachedAt`) enabling daily recomputation heuristics.

### üìä Metrics & Observability
- Added counters: `hmac_fail` (existing), new `scope_denied` for RBAC, and timeout tracking through unified code path.
- Hit ratio improvements reflected via corrected accounting method.

### üß™ Testing
- Added security-focused test suite (HMAC, RBAC, rate limit, input guards). Tests gracefully skip when live server not running to avoid false negatives in CI without network.

### üìÑ Documentation
- README Security & Access Control section expanded with RBAC scopes examples and updated feature table (`v3.2.x` section retains compatibility notes; version header updated to 3.3.0).
- SECURITY-CHECKLIST updated with runtime controls reflecting new abort mechanism and RBAC details.

### ‚ôªÔ∏è Internal Refinements
- Centralized redaction & scope resolution utilities inside server bootstrap.
- Reduced duplicate promise race wrappers in favor of intrinsic abort signaling.

### Migration Notes
No action required for existing 3.2.0 deployments unless enabling new RBAC scopes. To adopt RBAC:
1. Set `MCP_TOOL_SCOPES` JSON mapping (include "*" for default scopes).
2. Provide `x-mcp-scopes` header from client listing granted scopes.
3. Monitor `system.getMetrics` for `scope_denied` to validate configuration.

### Integrity Statement
All changes validated via TypeScript build (no new type errors) and targeted security tests. Functional behavior of existing tools unchanged unless restricted by newly configured scopes.
